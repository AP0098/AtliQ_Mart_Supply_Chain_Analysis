Code basis Challenge

Problem Statement

The expanding FMCG company AtliQ Mart has its headquarters located in Gujarat, India. Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodra are the three cities where it is now in operation. Within the following two years, they hope to grow to more metro areas and Tier 1 cities.
Due to service concerns, a few important clients of AtliQ Mart choose not to renew their annual contract. This presents a challenge for the company. There are rumors that some of the necessary products were either partially or not delivered at all over an extended period of time, which may have led to subpar customer service. The management has asked their supply chain analytics team to monitor the "On time" and "In full" delivery service level for every customer on a daily basis in order to address this problem before expanding to additional cities.
